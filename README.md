# Exposql-gen

> **The idea:**
> 1. Write a minimal lexer & parser for SQL's CREATE TABLE statements (target MySQL for now).
> 2. Generate a Kotlin DAO for that table (as well as supporting enum classes etc.).
> 
> **Possible additions:**
> - Gradle plugin to generate based on Annotations on a class

**WIP**
